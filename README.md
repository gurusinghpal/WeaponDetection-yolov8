Click on the picture to view a demonstration of the model's work on some videos from YouTube.\
**Stack:** YOLOv8, OpenCV. 
### Score
**mAP50:** 0.942.\
**Precision:** 0.918.\
**Recall:** 0.899.
### Dataset
The [original](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01058) dataset was created by Delong Qi, Weijun Tan, Zhifu Liu, Qi Yao, Jingfeng Liu.\
Some background pictures, augmentation and screenshots from real videos on YouTube were added to it.\
The data includes 6427 train (81.14%), 997 val (12.59%) and 497 test (6.27%) images.\
In the future, the model will be trained on the whole dataset (51K images).\
